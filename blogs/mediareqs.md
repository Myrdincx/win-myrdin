Pinegrove as a band has the remarkable ability to stir emotions within me that other artists simply can't. Their music strikes a perfect balance between looking towards the future, while holding onto a nostalgic past. Need 2 is what got me into listening to Pinegrove. 
The lyrics (only 10 lines!) paired with the charming atmosphere of the song, is able to strike a chord every single time. It really manages to capture the "raw human experience". <br>
No matter how often I come back to this song, it always gives me that same comforting feeling.

### Pinegrove - Rose

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) <br>

Yes, here’s another song by Pinegrove. I just discovered it yesterday while exploring some material for my previous review. This time, the track dates back to 2012! <br>
This song captures a similar feeling as "Need 2" does, although it isn't as well-known. 
I especially love the soothing harmony towards the end, around "No we won't leave this town". It manages to evoke such a nostalgic feeling only Pinegrove is able to create. The exact feeling is quite indescribable. With that being said, I would rate this song a 5/5, without a doubt. I truly wish I could listen to it again for the first time
